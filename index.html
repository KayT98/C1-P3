		<h1>A little bit about myself</h1>
        <h6>**I don't take picture, but you can see me on LinkedIn, I like my name in lowercase XD**</h6>
		<p>I graduated from Northeastern State University in Oklahoma, Spring 2022 with degree in Computer Science. A hardworking and passionate job seeker with 
            strong organizational skills, 
			with experience in HTML5 & CSS3, JavaScript(ES6), ReactJS, Front End Development and UI Design. 
			I used to be an intern Seminaut Inc as a Software and Frontend Developer specialized in UXUI, 
			I've gained a lots of valuable experience in Website Development during my time there. In my spare time, I study Frontend stuff and practice some coding 
            for more experience.
			I'm currently working as FC Associate at TUL5 and studying Amazon Software Development Training Program Cohort 4 at Correlation One.</p>

        <h4>I signed NDA with my internship company but I think it has expired, you can see one of the UI tasks I've done using React, Tailwind/CSS</h4>

                Your browser does not support the video tag, please use other browsers, recommend Chrome.
            </video>

            <p>I mainly worked on UI since I was a member of UXUI Dev team, backend devs will take care of the rest.
                I translated Figma file created by designers and imported the badges from 2 separate folders, will display 5 unlocked badges after users unlocked them through 
                a certain activity, and hide others. 
                Users can check other badges (both unlocked and locked) by clicking Display All Badges.
                Responsive on both mobile and desktop. Tailwind was a pain to write but everything turned out great.
                I'm pretty bad at designing, I can't really make good webpage without the helps of Desginers XD.
